    "\n",
    "#### Goal -   Determine / Predict if any food item has high additives based on various predictor variables. \n",
    "     \n",
    "  Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin.  Food with high amount of Additives may not be safe for consumption.  Certain Food Additive are not good for health, can be cancerous or cause Gastric Disturbance.We would like to identify such food items.\n",
    "     \n",
    "We would like to know if because of certain ingredient, chance of additives being added to food is higher. Or for a particular Category of food additives are high or does the fat content / sugar content determine if additives need to be added to food item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea is to build a predictive model (using Logistic Regression), which predicts if food items in the dataset has high additive. We would also identify which country has high amount of additives added to food. We shall be focusing on the data regarding Ingredients, Categories, Additives_n and Additives in general. We would also do preliminary Exploratory Analysis on the Dataset and plot certain characteristics of data. \n",

    "The Open Food Facts database is open data published under the Open Database Licence. So data collected in the database is updated by the Contributors. Hence data for a particular country would exist only if any person has actually updated the data for the country. All the countries may not have enough of data.

    "#### 6.1 Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "Observations based on the model developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Frozen Foods -'is_frozen' has 0.16 times less chances of having high additives .\n",
    "2. Palm oil - Ingredients with Palm Oil has the maximum chances /probability - 2.20 times of having high additives\n",
    "3. If the Food item is a Beverage ,we also have a huge chance of additive mainly if it is Carbonated. Similarly Sugary Snacks also has more chances of high additives.\n",
    "4. Total number of ingredients also has an impact on the high additives in food.\n",
    "5. Plant based foods and Beverages has 0.32 times less chances of having high additives. So we can recommend eating more Plant based food as they are safe for consumption\n",
    "6. Food with honey has least chances after frozen food i.e. 0.25 times less chances for additives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similair observations can be done for the remaining ingredients or Categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2 - Future Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As we predicted the high additive based on the Ingredients, Categories and No of Ingredients, we can extend the model to check if fat content, sugar content ..etc has an effect on the accuracy / prediction . Similarly we can extend the model using all ingredients in dataset and check the effect on the high additive. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can also predict the column - 'nutritional_grade_fr' / 'nutritional_grade_uk' using the Ingredients / Categories / Fat Content / Vitamins...etc making a  Logistic Regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Nutritional Grade numerical values can be used to grade them as 'A' , 'B' , 'C' or 'D'. We could also use Clustering method to identify the clusters within the dataset for these grades."
